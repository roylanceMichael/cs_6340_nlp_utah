    John got up one morning and discovered his power was out. Unable
    to shave, he called his next door neighbor and asked if he could
    come over to borrow the bathroom. But everyone on the street was
    out. So John called FG&E and drove to work hoping no one would see
    him before he found a bathroom with hot water. Unfortunately, he
    ran into his boss on the elevator. He explained his predicament,
    but did not feel reassured by Mr. Carver's stoney silence. John
    stumbled through the rest of the week half-expecting to find a
    pink slip in his mailbox.
